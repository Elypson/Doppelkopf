# Doppelkopf
This is going to be a client/server Doppelkopf game with Server written in C# and Client written in HTML/Js based on WebSockets. You will be able to play it online on our server (TBA), but you will also be able to host it yourself.

This is a work-in-progress version. Once it is available to use, we will announce so via this README.
